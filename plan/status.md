# MemoGarden Project Status

**Last Updated**: 2025-12-27

## Active Step

**Step 1 COMPLETE - Core Backend Foundation ✅**

All 7 substeps finished:
- ✅ Project Setup & Structure
- ✅ SQLite Database Schema (entity registry pattern)
- ✅ Pydantic Schemas (API validation)
- ✅ Flask Application & Configuration
- ✅ API Endpoints Implementation (7 transaction endpoints)
- ✅ Testing Infrastructure (231 tests, 90% coverage)
- ✅ Documentation & Development Workflow (comprehensive README with API docs)

## Repository

**Core API**: https://github.com/memogarden/memogarden-core

## Completed Work

### Architecture Refactor (All 18 Steps)
- ✅ Utils module (isodatetime, uid) with full tests
- ✅ Schema module with domain types (Timestamp, Date)
- ✅ Query builders (db/query.py)
- ✅ EntityOperations and TransactionOperations classes
- ✅ Core API (db/__init__.py) with atomic transactions
- ✅ All endpoints migrated to Core API
- ✅ @validate_request decorator implemented
- ✅ Schemas moved to api/v1/schemas/
- ✅ Legacy database.py removed
- ✅ Documentation updated (AGENTS.md, architecture.md)

### Documentation Refactor (2025-12-24)
- ✅ AGENTS.md condensed from 752 to 179 lines (76% reduction)
- ✅ Created 7 Agent Skills for task-specific workflows
  - memogarden-development: environment setup, constraints, anti-patterns
  - memogarden-testing: testing philosophy and workflows
  - memogarden-api-endpoint: API endpoint creation
  - memogarden-debugging: debugging workflows
  - memogarden-schema: schema modifications + data model reference
  - change-reviewer: pre-commit review workflow
  - change-commit: git commit operations
- ✅ Created 3 convenience scripts (run.sh, test.sh, test-coverage.sh)
- ✅ Created plan/status.md for project status tracking
- ✅ Scripts pre-approved in .claude/settings.local.json

### Schema Extension Design (2025-12-24)
- ✅ Created plan/future/ directory for future design work
- ✅ Documented schema extension system design (schema-extension-design.md)
  - Base schema vs. Extensions philosophy
  - Two extension mechanisms (structured SQL + JSON data)
  - JSON Schema format and extension metadata
  - Extension lifecycle and sharing
- ✅ Documented migration mechanism (migration-mechanism.md)
  - Complete migration workflow
  - Deconfliction rules and validation
  - Default value application and rollback strategy
- ✅ Documented Memogarden Soil architecture (soil-design.md)
  - Directory structure and archival workflow
  - Fossilization mechanism (lossy compaction)
  - Retrieval and reconstruction APIs

### Documentation Updates (2025-12-27)
- ✅ Updated memogarden-schema skill to reference /plan/future/ design docs
- ✅ Updated memogarden-development skill with Future Design Reference section
- ✅ Updated memogarden-development skill with Working Directory Reminder
- ✅ Updated memogarden-testing skill with enhanced working directory reminder
- ✅ Updated implementation plan Step 1.6.5 to reference /plan/future/ docs
- ✅ Fixed all async references in implementation plan (now consistent with sync Flask + sqlite3)
- ✅ Updated testing infrastructure section to reflect Flask (not FastAPI)
- ✅ Updated documentation section to reflect manual API docs (no auto-generated Swagger)
- ✅ Completed Step 1.6: Testing Infrastructure (231 tests, 90% coverage)
- ✅ Added pytest-cov to dev dependencies
- ✅ Completed Step 1.7: Documentation & Development Workflow

### Testing Infrastructure (2025-12-27)
- ✅ 231 tests passing (excellent coverage across all modules)
- ✅ 90% test coverage (exceeds 80% target)
- ✅ Test fixtures in conftest.py (test_db, client)
- ✅ pytest-cov configured for coverage reporting
- ✅ Tests organized by module: api/, db/, schema/, utils/

### Step 1 Completion: Core Backend Foundation (2025-12-27) ✅
- ✅ **Complete CRUD API**: 7 transaction endpoints (create, read, update, delete, list, labels)
- ✅ **Comprehensive Documentation**: README.md with curl examples for all API endpoints
- ✅ **Working Directory Reminders**: Added to agent skills to prevent directory confusion
- ✅ **End-to-End Validation**: Verified server startup, API responses, test execution
- ✅ **Development Scripts**: run.sh, test.sh, test-coverage.sh in parent directory
- ✅ **Environment Variables**: All documented in .env.example

## Architectural Decisions

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (synchronous) + sqlite3 (built-in Python module)
- **Philosophy**: Deterministic synchronous execution for simplicity and debugging
- **Rationale**: Personal system with low traffic; sync is simpler and more maintainable than async

### Design Principles
- **No ORM**: Raw SQL queries with parameterized statements
- **Entity Registry**: Global metadata table for all entity types
- **Labels not Entities**: Accounts and categories are user-defined strings
- **UTC Everywhere**: All timestamps in ISO 8601 UTC format
- **Test-Driven**: Comprehensive test suite (>80% coverage target)

## Next Steps

See [implementation.md](implementation.md) for detailed roadmap.

**Ready for**: Step 2 (Authentication & Multi-User Support) OR Production Deployment

**Step 1 (Core Backend Foundation) is complete!** All major components implemented:
- RESTful API with transaction CRUD
- Entity registry pattern for global metadata
- 90% test coverage (231 tests)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Development workflow validated
